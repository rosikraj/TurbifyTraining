req>>>>
1) write a java program to display pattern in below way.
	1a 2b 3c 4d 5e . ... . .. .z26
2)Program to display 24 table.
3)Explore the memory size of datatypes in java.
4)Display your mobile your using java use only (int datatype)
5)Using do-while,display 1 to 50 in reverse order.

      access to all	     not access to all
>>Static will be loaded into memory first,
>>no need to create object for static

>>Non-static will be loaded last.We need to create object for non-static.
>>>>....=========<<<<
>>main is a static variable
>>Static doesn't know about Non-static
(ambani don't about people)---ambani is static ,people is Non static
(people know ambani)
>>>>>static is loaded in memory so Non-static can acess static
>>static have keywords , non-static don't have keyboard

DAY4

>local variables should installize
>class variables have default value
>java cant cosider garbage value because java dont have pointers
>instalizing for final varible is important keep eye on it other wise it leads to error while using
>only for class variable we need to create object
>non static is object
>static is avaible is memory
>main memory is static

Hi Navya, Prakruthi
Please find Tasks accomplished for today-
1)Attended the JAVA training session today.
2)Learned about arrays,String,For loop,Switch statements,and executed programs regarding these topics.
3)Introduction to OOPs
4)Pages read from book- 4(17-20)
Issues/Doubts : None

DAY5
PACKAGE
>>package is collection of (ANY package we hava) classes,methods,interface,acstract class,variables.
 2 types of packages
>>user defined- anything we created
>>pre-defined- Any package which is part of your jdk
====

void-no return
return-control back to jvm

>>>new stat()--memory will be allocated by jvm
>>unnamed block-when obj created
=================================
Constructors
>>we may have return but it wont return any value but there is a way
it is a method whose name is same as class name
>>constructors will be within a class
>>function name is anything but constructor name is same as class name
>>function return value 
>>CONSTRUCTORS ARE OF 2 TYPES
>>1)parametrized(Screenshort -83-87)
>>2)empty constructor
>>3)default:if developer is not providing any constructor , then JVM will provide default 
{stat()-empty constructor}
>>{stat("srinivas")-parametrized
+++++++++++++++++++++
>>USES OF OBJECT CREATION:
1)Unnamed blocls esill be called
2)memory allocation
3)reference will be created
4)class level

>Task1:
create a java program  which class varaiable as int array and display the values in that array using display method.

POLYMORPHISM (one thing with different use)
OVERLOADING AND OVERIDING
...screenshort(89)
Rules for Method Overloading:
==============================
The overloaded method must change the argument list (number of parameters, data type, or sequence of parameters).
The overloaded method can change the return type.
The overloaded method can change the access modifier (the signature of the function should be different). 
==========overloading occurs in same class(dwithin the class)
>>===========================
============
Overriding (90-91)
>Overridding means using same function 
>=======================================================================================<
ENCAPSULATON
(hiding unneccertity details showing imp details)
>>================================<<
INHERITANCE
aquring propertise from parent class
>parent/base/super class
>child class , derived class
>>main job: no need to create any code we can acqure property from parent class
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>...................
>..............................
Rules for Method Overiding:
===========================
>he argument list should be exactly the same as that of the overridden method.
The return type should be the same or a subtype of the return type declared in the original overridden method in the superclass.
The access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method's access level. For example: If the superclass method is declared public then the overriding method in the subclass cannot be either private or protected.
Instance methods can be overridden only if they are inherited by the subclass.
A method declared final cannot be overridden.
A method declared static cannot be overridden but can be re-declared.
If a method cannot be inherited, then it cannot be overridden.
A subclass within the same package as the instance's superclass can override any superclass method that is not declared private or final.
A subclass in a different package can only override the non-final methods declared public or protected.
An overriding method can throw any uncheck exceptions, regardless of whether the overridden method throws exceptions or not. However, the overriding method should not throw checked exceptions that are new or broader than the ones declared by the overridden method. The overriding method can throw narrower or fewer exceptions than the overridden method.
Constructors cannot be overridden.

INHERITANCE
(SS 95-96)
>>IN JAVA FOR RVERY CLASS , OBJECT IS THE BASE CLASS
>>FOR EVERY CLASS BASE CLASSS IS OBJECT
==============
an object can be clone (duplicate object)
TASK 2 sinle inheritance
>>A class extends class
>> there is no extends to extend
>>an interface can exdends interface

>>TASK :
DIAMOND PROBLEM? IN JAVA
>>TASK: DEALING WITH CONSTRUCTORS IN MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE

interface
abstract class

LISTwe can add,modife objects in list
>list is a interface .
>we can add,modife objects in list
